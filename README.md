# jtd_dutytoggle
A police On / Off Duty toggle script

A simple toggle on / toggle off duty script for FiveM ESX. 

To install, simply:

1. Install the .sql file (Keep this the same name)
2. type: 
    ensure jtd_dutytoggle
  Into your server.cfg
  
 That should then allow it to work!
 
 
 
 I created this script originally for PGN, but we parted ways so i'm allowing anyone to download this. Sadly though, no support shall be given. This script was created a while ago so may not be up to the standards of other scripts.
 
 However, I do make vehicle models that can be found here:
